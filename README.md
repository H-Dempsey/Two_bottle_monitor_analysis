The Two Bottle Monitor is an open source [automated mouse homecage two-bottle choice test device](https://hackaday.io/project/160388-automated-mouse-homecage-two-bottle-choice-test-v2).
It was developed by Meaghan Creed, Lex Kravitz, Jibran Khokhar and Lizzy Godynyuk.

__Purpose__

The CSV output from the these devices are in 1 min time bins. For the creation of custom time bin lengths, this repository:
* Slightly the C++ Arduino code to output timestamps of events, rather than time bins.
* Provides a Python GUI which converts this output into a time binned file with a custom bin length.
* The GUI can also group analysis for each of the varibles Left Count, Left Duration, Right Count and Right Duration. <br>

Also check out [SipperViz](https://github.com/earnestt1234/SipperViz), which provides more GUI functionality and analysis tools.
